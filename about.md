My name is Arun (pronounced _uh-roon_) Allamsetty (let's not try pronouncing that). I am your average Joe from a small town in India, Bhilai (pronounced _bhee-la-e_). I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu/) in Spring '15. I am currently working at [Instructure Inc.](https://www.instructure.com/) as a Big Data Engineer.

I have never (actively) blogged before, but I intend to start now. I also plan to contribute to code to opensource projects and publish tutorials/notes. I hope I'll be active enough to be of some use to people.
