So I decided to create a website to write about the things I am learning. In my opinion, it would be a great way to document everything so that I can refer back to it when I need to. I am hoping this would also be helpful to others as a side-effect.

This website has been created using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), which generates static HTML pages from plaintext files written in popular formats. Since I am trying to gain proficiency in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which happens to be a format which Jekyll supports, I decided to use it.

Stay tuned for (interesting) content.
